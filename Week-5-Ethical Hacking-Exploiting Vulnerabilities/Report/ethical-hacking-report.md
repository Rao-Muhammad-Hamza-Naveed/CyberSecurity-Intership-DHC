\# OWASP Juice Shop Penetration Testing Report



\# Environment Setup



\# OWASP Juice Shop was deployed in a Kali Linux environment using Docker. Windows native builds caused dependency and compatibility issues; therefore, Kali Linux was selected as it provides a stable and industry-standard penetration testing environment.



\# Step 3: Reconnaissance



The following reconnaissance commands were executed from the Kali Linux terminal:

• nmap -A localhost

• whatweb http://localhost:3000

• nikto -h http://localhost:3000



\# Step 4: Manual SQL Injection

A manual SQL Injection attack was performed on the login functionality of OWASP Juice Shop. The payload ' OR 1=1-- was injected into the email field, successfully bypassing authentication and confirming the presence of an SQL Injection vulnerability.



\# Step 5: Automated SQL Injection using SQLMap

SQLMap was used directly through the Kali Linux terminal to automate SQL Injection testing on the login API endpoint (/rest/user/login). The tool successfully detected an SQL Injection vulnerability in the email parameter and allowed enumeration of the database, tables, and extraction of user credentials.



\# Conclusion



The assessment confirmed multiple critical security vulnerabilities within OWASP Juice Shop, specifically SQL Injection flaws. These findings highlight the importance of secure input validation, proper authentication mechanisms, and continuous security testing.
